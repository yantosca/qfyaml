About qfyaml
############

The Quick Fortran YAML parser (:program:`qfyaml`) is a standalone
package for reading fields from YAML files directly into Fortran.  It was
created by `Bob Yantosca <https://yantosca.github.io>`__ as a way to
read configuration files into the `GEOS-Chem model <http://geos-chem.org>`_.

:program:`Qfyaml` (which builds upon the
`config-fortran <https://github.com/jannisteunissen/config_fortran>`_
package by H. J. Teunissen) uses F95 language syntax so that it can be
built with most versions of the GNU and Intel Fortran compilers.
