Contributing to qfyaml
######################

We welcome new code additions to qfyaml in the form of `pull requests
<https://github.com/yantosca/qfyaml/pulls>`_. 
If you have an example you would like to add to this ReadTheDocs site,
you can add it to the :file:`test` folder in the qfyaml repository 
and submit a pull request with this added file. If you would like to
suggest changes to the documentation on this site, you can do so by  
describing your changes in a Github issue or by directly editing the
source RST files included in the qfyaml repository  
and submitting a pull request with your changes. 

We do not currently have an automated testing pipeline operational for
:program:`qfyaml`. We ask that you test any changes against an
unchanged version of :program:`qfyaml`.  Any further testing before
finalizing your pull request is greatly appreciated.
