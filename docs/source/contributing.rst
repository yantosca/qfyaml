We welcome new code additions to :program:`qfyaml` in the form of `pull requests
<https://github.com/yantosca/qfyaml/pulls>`_.  If you have an example
you would like to add to this ReadTheDocs site,  
you can add it to the :file:`test` folder in the `qfyaml repository
<https://github.com/yantosca/qfyaml>`_  and submit a pull request with
this added file.

If you would like to suggest changes to the documentation on this
site, you can do so by describing your changes in a Github issue.  You
may also do so by editing the source ReST files (located in the folder
:file:`qfyaml/docs/source`) and submitting a pull request with
your changes.

We do not currently have an automated testing pipeline operational for
:program:`qfyaml`. We ask that you test any changes against an
unchanged version of :program:`qfyaml`.  Any further testing before
finalizing your pull request is greatly appreciated.
