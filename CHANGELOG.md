    (i.e. Nitrogen Oxide) will have quotes placed around it.
  - `bin/.cleanBinDir.sh` is now `bin/cleanup.sh`.  It will also
    remove files generated by the make process in the `build/` folder.

  - Updated ReadTheDocs documentation accordingly
  - Now use proper title & section headings in the ReadTheDocs *.rst files
